# Resources
I do a lot of breaking stuff at home. Literally. It wouldn't be offsive security if I didn't try harder. Without some of the resources I would be lost in the sauce. Keep in mind these are running lists:
<br>
<h2>Books</h2>
Most of these are tech manuals. Without a doubt, <a href="https://nostarch.com/">No Starch Press</a> and <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/">Packt></a> are my favorite tech publishers. For the one's that aren't techmans, they are Important in shaping who I am toady.
